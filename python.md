#Python

Python is one of the many programming languages that are used to write programs. They can be used for desktop applications, meaning programs that operate locally (operate on your own computer) or they can be used for programs that run on a server and are part of a website. It is a good idea to start with Python or Ruby as a beginning because they are relatively simple in syntax and quite general purpose. There are two versions of Python that are used a lot: Python 2 and Python 3. Python 3 is the newer version but only about 30% of the Python software is written in it. Most of the Python software is written in Python 2 so that is why some of the resources are in Python 2, some are in Python 3 because as with the software, not all tutorials have updated their syntax on Python 3. This is going to be a slow, gradual process. 

We will speak about the Python interpreter a bit. There are two types of languages: those that are compiles and those that are interpreted. It all goes down to how the program is turned into a machine language. In Python there is a middle-man: the Python interpreter that is the first "person" who reads your program. 

##Useful Resources: 

**Note:** Some of the resources are on Python 2 and some are on Python 3. Here is what to have in mind: 

1. You run a command in the command line in python 3 by using python3 name_of_the_file.py. 

2. You should put parenthesis on the print method, meaning print("string"). In Python 2 you can just use print "string"

3. When you ask for keyboard input, in Python 3 you use input, whereas in Python 2 you use raw_input. 

**Another note:** Some of the resources ask you to write your Python programs in a separate file in your text editor and run it by using the command-line. Some of the resources use the Python interpreter to demonstrate the result of some lines of code. The first approach should be somewhat familiar because so far, we have created all our HTML and other files like that. When you are doing serious programming in future, you will be using this approach. If you are just interested in the result of a function, expression, etc. you use the Python interpreter. You start it by typing python in the command line. What happens is that you start the Python interpreter and when you type a line of code and press Enter, it gives you the outcome of the line of code on the next line. If you type 3 + 5, it will return 8. So when you see some code that starts with >> it is in the interpreter, so start Python in your command line. To get out of the interpreter and back to your normal command line, press Control and C at the same time. 

**If you have a problem with some exercise, check whether you use the correct syntax for the version you are using.**

As the DVD is unreadable unless you have a DVD player so is the file without file handler. That is why we created a variable target in ex 16.

**Time for review!!! <3 Hurray**: go back to every single exercise you did and do it again. It is going to take you about a week to review. If yo finish faster, here are some additional resources:
