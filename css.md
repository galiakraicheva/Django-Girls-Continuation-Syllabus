#CSS

During the previous exercises on HTML, you notices a couple of times that tags have attributes that deal with the formatting of the text. Well, CSS is a language that is all about the attributes of HTML. You specify an element, for example h1, and saw: I want all my headings 2 to be this big, with green color, font Ariel, etc. And all h2-s on your page become like that. If you later change your mind and you want all h2-s to be pink, than you just change the color in one place and all h2-s become pink. So finally, you end up with a list of instructions what how each element looks. Where do you place this list? Usually in a separate file with an extension .css (you write it again in your text editor). But if there are two files: one with the HTML and one with the CSS, how do we connect the formating to the HTML? We import it in the head section of the HTML.  

Now it time to get familiar with the syntax:
