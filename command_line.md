# Command Line

So here we go with the serious but fun stuff. The command line is means through which you give commands to your computer. There are other ways to give commands as well: such as using your mouse and clicking on the left or right button. However, the command line is even more powerful and you can do a lot of things that you can't do with a mouse. Actually, the command line interface was used long before there were mouses and long before there was a user-friendly graphical user interface and is still used because of its power. Those black screens with a lot of lines of code in the movies are usually the command line that the hackers use to do their hacker things. On the less heroic side, every beginner programmer also uses them so will we.
