##Ruby

Ruby is one of the many languages in which you can write programs. These programs can be on your website, on a small computer like Raspberry pi, or they can be programs that you install on your home computer and work on them locally. The programs written in Ruby are nothing more than a bunch of files usually with the extention .rb . Ruby is one of the easiest to learn languages and there are pretty good tutorials for it. So now, let's start :)

So now we can continue with more Ruby:

Logic and boolean operators: [Learn Ruby the Hard Way, ex 27) (https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex27.html) & [Learn Python the Hard Way, ex 28] (https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex28.html): in ex27, if you find difficulties, try to say to your self In order the whole statement to be true, both this and this whould be true for and. In order the whole statement to be true, either this or this should be true and you will not make mistakes. In ex28, use your interptreter to check whether you got the answers right: you start it by typing python to the command line. 

If, elsif, else: [Learn Ruby the Hard Way: ex29, 30 & 31] (https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) & [Ruby for Beginners] (http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/conditionals.html)
