##Ruby

Ruby is one of the many languages in which you can write programs. These programs can be on your website, on a small computer like Raspberry pi, or they can be programs that you install on your home computer and work on them locally. The programs written in Ruby are nothing more than a bunch of files usually with the extention .rb . Ruby is one of the easiest to learn languages and there are pretty good tutorials for it. So now, let's start :)
