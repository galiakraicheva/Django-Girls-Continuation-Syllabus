#Anatomy of a Computer

Note: When I decided to write a bit about computer's anatomy, a lot of programmers around me told me that you needn't know what's inside a computer. It may be true that there is not need to know every little detail, however I remember what sort of a show stopper it was for me the first time I started programming. And I am sure that you are interested or at least, think it may be useful, even though you may overestimate the use of it. So don't try to remember every bit and piece of it, just read it for your own enjoyment and to get a rudimentary knowledge about computer components. 

##CPU
The 'brain' of the computer is the CPU (central processing unit). You may have heard about Pentium, made by Intel (the name of the company). Well, it is a CPU. You are on Windows, you may have wondered which version of a program to download: the 32 or the 64-bit version. Well, again it has to do with what your CPU is (most modern computers have CPUs capable of running 64-bit programs). 

The CPU is a small chip with:

1. Metal or plastic wrapping
2. Metal connectors
3. Very compex wiring usually made of silicon

The wiring also contains transistors (they are the cells of the 'brain' of the computter, just like your have neuron cells in your brain). They are very, very tiny and their number is huge (there are several billions of them). What is more, due to technological achievments, the number of transistors doubles each two years (this observation is known as Moore's law).

So what the CPU does, is to take data from the memory of the computer (or somewhere else), change it according to what the program running wants and then return it in the memory of the computer (or somewhere else). The CPU, also called a processor, processes data and is the thing that actually runs your programs. 

##Storage/Memory
Your computer keeps all the data somewhere: your files, the code of programs such as Word, the operating system such as Windows, Linux or other, and many more things that the computer needs to 'remember'. 

There are three types of storage: 

1. Primary storage: called random access memory (RAM) or just memory
2. Secondary storage: your hard disk
3. Removable storage: your USB, a CD, an external hard disk, etc.

Modern computers can make several billions operations per second because they have very advanced CPU. Hard drives are still a lot slower than the needs of the processor since the processor can manipulate much more data than can be transferred from and to the hard drive. So there is a middle step: the RAM. RAM is very fast memory, much faster compared to the hard-drive. On the downside, it is much more expensive and it is only temporary: once the electricity goes off, all data in it is lost. Let's give an example: you write on Word a paper and you last saved it 3 minutes ago. Unfortunately, electricity goes off and when it comes back, you have several words missing because they weren't saved on the hard disk or on a removable storage. They were only saved in the RAM. 

##Peripheral devices, motherboard and buses

To interact with computers you need a screen, a mouse, a keyboard, a printer, etc. These are all called peripheral devices since they get connected to the computer through an outside cable (oftentimes). The different parts of the computer transfer data through electrical lines, called buses. They connect the CPU, the electronics of the hard disk, the RAM and the plugs of the outside devises, where they get plugged into the computer. All the components of the computer: CPU, hard disk, video card, network card, electrical buses, etc. lie neatly in a plastic bed, called motherboard. 

##Variations

Nowadays, most of the programs are not implemented inside a single computer. When you sit on a computer, you may use cloud services, instead of the local hard disk or the computer can be part of a network. In this case, you can save your files in some other computer's hard disk or you can even use some other computer's CPU to run your programs.
