#Ruby on Rails

text, text, explain what Ruby gem is: wikipedia says RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.

The interface for RubyGems is a command-line tool called gem which can install libraries and manage RubyGems.[1] RubyGems integrates with Ruby run-time loader to help find and load installed gems from standardized library folders.
