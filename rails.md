#Ruby on Rails

As I have previously said, Ruby on Rails (or Rails for short) is a framework for developing web applications in Ruby. But what does a framework actually do? Every website with some programs on is more complex than just having a couple of HTML files. So it needs additional things: a place to keep your database information, a place to keep your CSS, a place to keep your images, error pages, tests for the programs, etc. They need to be organized and properly documented (meaning that there should be explanations what does what on the site). A programmer can do all the folders and connections between the files and the databases by him/herself but that is a long task prone to mistakes. That is why, it is better to use a tool that generates an "empty" general purpose working site for us. Such a tool is Rails. 

In order to use it, you must first install it locally or select an Internet IDE that mimics what you see when you work locally. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a program that simulates your command line, your file structure and your text editor. If you are using Atom, it is like an Atom with a separate mini window for writing commands for the command-line. My advice for Ruby on Rails is to work locally because it gives you more practice. To be honest, installing Rails on your computer may be a headache but you should at least try it before choosing to work on an IDE. 

text, text, explain what Ruby gem is: wikipedia says RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them.

The interface for RubyGems is a command-line tool called gem which can install libraries and manage RubyGems.[1] RubyGems integrates with Ruby run-time loader to help find and load installed gems from standardized library folders.

Intro + a Couple of Terms: [Rails Tutorial.com: Chapter 1, From Zero to Deploy, sections up to 1.1 including] (https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning): don't spend time clicking on all the additional links with resources. They are all payed and you will find enough practice throughout the tutorial and the additional resouces so you don't need to pay

Installing Rails and Setting Up a Database for Ubuntu [Go Rails] (https://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/16.04): alternatively, you can use an IDE that is recommended in the Rail's Tutorial. I guess so far everybody has switched to Ubuntu one way or another (by virtual box or on a USB key) but if you are using another operating system, google for instructions.
