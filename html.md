#HTML

As we said, HTML is the language that the browser reads to display the webpage and the way it does that is by saying to the browser: "Hey! Here is what the meaning of the text inside the page is: this is a heading, so it is more important than the rest of the text, here is a list of items, make bullet points, and this is an image. Oh, and a link, which should lead to another page!". So it instructs the browser which line of text is what (heading, paragraph, link, etc.). But how do you instruct the browser? What instructions does it understand? It understands tags. These are short comments, written between < and > and most of the tags come in pairs: an opening and a closing tag, which say: "The heading, paragraph or any other element starts from here and finishes here." There are hundreds and hundreds of tags but don't worry. Even the best programmers usually don't know them by heart.

**Another important note:** Programmers don't know everything by heart. Only some basic commands that they use often. Instead, they know that they can do this or that and they read on the Internet the exact syntax. You should do the same every time you forget about a tag or a command. 

Here is a useful list of resources, which will teach you everything you need to know about HTML!

##Useful Resources: 

Introduction to HTML: [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web) until Lesson 2: HTML Structure; all the tags in this lesson are quite often used so most programmers know them without checking online

HTML Basics II: [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web): take at least HTML Basics II sections from 1 to 7 and 14, 15. These tags are used quite often.

HTML Basics III: [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web): pay attention to the div and span sections. Sometime ago programmers used to style websites with tables (if the site had 3 columns, they were using a table with three columns), now everybody is styling with div elements so you will see them a lot in your future life as a programmer.

Div and Span tags: [Tutorials Point] (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/html_blocks.htm) & [HTML dog] (http://www.htmldog.com/guides/html/intermediate/spandiv/)
