#Django

Now you already have a good understanding of Python and you can write your programs in it. You can start one by one to build your files to create your website eventually. Not long time ago, this was what everybody did. However, soon programmers began to notice that they are doing the same things every time they decided to have a new website. They had similar structure and they were building the same tools: admin panel, lists of urls, templates for the webpages, etc. So as smart programmers do, they decided to get together and create a tool that itself creates the skeleton of the website: all these repetitive directories and files that they needed to put together by hand. Django is such a tool: a framework that builds for you a directory-file system that the server understands and runs so that you don't need to create these files on your own. 

In the Django context you will inevitably run into some terms so I explain in advance: 

**Packages:** 

**Pip:**

**Virtual environment:** let's start with an environment itself. An environment is a directory that consists of all you need to run a program, a website, a project. It contains a copy of the Python binary, the standard library, the pip installer (explained below) and the directory that contains all packages. In Python it is very important to set a virtual environment because it saves a lot of troubles with the packages.
